# International Student Mental Health Analysis

This project explores mental health outcomes among international students at a Japanese university. Using PostgreSQL, we analyze how factors such as social connectedness, acculturative stress, and length of stay relate to depression scores.

## Overview

International students may experience higher risks of mental health difficulties than local students. This project examines:

- Social connectedness (belonging to a social group)  
- Acculturative stress (stress from adapting to a new culture)  
- Length of stay in the host country  

## Analysis
